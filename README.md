# atom-cscope package

Using cscope within Atom Code Editor CUZ I wanted one.
This is my first Atom package(PLS be gentle) which I created out of need since 
I was not able to find any package which could let me use cscope in Atom. (It 
may be there but is probably buried under a million packages so I could not 
find it.)
